# WUM - Web Usage Monitor

Monitor and display your internet usage in real-time using this Python script based on psutil and curses.

## Introduction

Web Usage Monitor is a Python script that allows you to monitor and display your internet usage in real-time. It provides information on the amount of data sent and received since Wi-Fi activation, helping you keep track of your network usage.

The script is particularly useful for individuals working remotely and relying on their phone's tethering functionality for internet access. It enables you to monitor your data usage while connected to your phone's shared connection, ensuring you stay within your data plan limits.

The script uses the psutil library to retrieve network statistics and the curses library to create a text-based user interface. By running the script, you can see the data sent and received since Wi-Fi activation in gigabytes (GB).
